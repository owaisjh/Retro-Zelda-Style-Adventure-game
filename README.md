Synopsis

A Preface
The goal of this project was to try and analyze and mimic basic
computer automated movement. The computer in this project
recognizes player motion and penalizes the player accordingly.
We have sat down and studied enemy AI from video games
primarily made in the 1970s running to the early 1980s.
Rudimentary AI in the video games of the 70s primarily
recognized player motion similar to our project. The history of
video game development is an interesting and often neglected
part of computer development. Many games today run on
incredibly complex algorithms which successfully mimic real life to
a frightening degree of accuracy. Game development has helped
further AI development and is even used in testing AI.

A Brief History
Game playing was an area of research in AI from its inception.
One of the first examples of AI is the computerised game of Nim
made in 1951 and published in 1952. Despite being advanced
technology in the year it was made, 20 years before Pong, the
game took the form of a relatively small box and was able to
regularly win games even against highly skilled players of the
game. In 1951, using the Ferranti Mark 1 machine of the
University of Manchester, Christopher Strachey wrote a checkers
program and Dietrich Prinz wrote one for chess. These were
among the first computer programs ever written. Arthur Samuel&#39;s
checkers program, developed in the middle 50s and early 60s,

eventually achieved sufficient skill to challenge a respectable
amateur.Work on checkers and chess would culminate in the
defeat of Garry Kasparov by IBM&#39;s Deep Blue computer in 1997.
The first video games developed in the 1960s and early 1970s,
like Spacewar!, Pong, and Gotcha (1973), were games
implemented on discrete logic and strictly based on the
competition of two players, without AI.

Games that featured a single player mode with enemies started
appearing in the 1970s. The first notable ones for the arcade
appeared in 1974: the Taito game Speed Race and the Atari
games Qwak (duck hunting light gun shooter) and Pursuit (fighter
aircraft dogfighting simulator). Two text-based computer games
from 1972, Hunt the Wumpus and Star Trek, also had enemies.
Enemy movement was based on stored patterns. The
incorporation of microprocessors would allow more computation
and random elements overlaid into movement patterns.
It was during the golden age of video arcade games that the idea
of AI opponents was largely popularized, due to the success of
Space Invaders (1978), which sported an increasing difficulty
level, distinct movement patterns, and in-game events dependent
on hash functions based on the player&#39;s input. Galaxian (1979)
added more complex and varied enemy movements, including
maneuvers by individual enemies who break out of formation.
Pac-Man (1980) introduced AI patterns to maze games, with the
added quirk of different personalities for each enemy. Karate
Champ (1984) later introduced AI patterns to fighting games,
although the poor AI prompted the release of a second version.
First Queen (1988) was a tactical action RPG which featured
characters that can be controlled by the computer&#39;s AI in following
the leader.The role-playing video game Dragon Quest IV (1990)

introduced a &quot;Tactics&quot; system, where the user can adjust the AI
routines of non-player characters during battle, a concept later
introduced to the action role-playing game genre by Secret of
Mana (1993).

Games like Madden Football, Earl Weaver Baseball and Tony La
Russa Baseball all based their AI on an attempt to duplicate on
the computer the coaching or managerial style of the selected
celebrity. Madden, Weaver and La Russa all did extensive work
with these game development teams to maximize the accuracy of
the games. Later sports titles allowed users to &quot;tune&quot; variables in
the AI to produce a player-defined managerial or coaching
strategy.

The emergence of new game genres in the 1990s prompted the
use of formal AI tools like finite state machines. Real-time strategy
games taxed the AI with many objects, incomplete information,
pathfinding problems, real-time decisions and economic planning,
among other things. The first games of the genre had notorious
problems. Herzog Zwei (1989), for example, had almost broken
pathfinding and very basic three-state state machines for unit
control, and Dune II (1992) attacked the players&#39; base in a beeline
and used numerous cheats. Later games in the genre exhibited
more sophisticated AI.
Later games have used bottom-up AI methods, such as the
emergent behaviour and evaluation of player actions in games
like Creatures or Black &amp; White. Façade (interactive story) was
released in 2005 and used interactive multiple way dialogs and AI
as the main aspect of game.

Games have provided an environment for developing artificial
intelligence with potential applications beyond gameplay.
Examples include Watson, a Jeopardy!-playing computer; and the
RoboCup tournament, where robots are trained to compete in
soccer.
To sum it up, Artificial Intelligence in video gaming started out in
meek fashion in the 1950s and didn’t really take off until the
1980s when video game popularity started increasing. With this
increase, more interest was paid to designing AI and as a result,
AI developed and is still developing rapidly.
